### Commit details

Here is some important steps and commands that can help me in the future usecase: 

Installation: 

We are going to make Dialog. So we install some components from shadcn. We install input, dilog and form 
that use react hook form.

``` 
npx shadcn-ui@latest add input
npx shadcn-ui@latest add dialog
npx shadcn-ui@latest add form
```


First we install all the ui packages. But also we also need to work with forms. 

So, we need to install : 

```yarn add react-hook-form```


By installing that you also will got build-in zod library. If it its not in case you can install it manually. It is used for form authorization.

```yarn add zod```
